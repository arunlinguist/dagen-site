

Just like in a funding application, a job application — whether or not it’s directly related to your current research interests — will require a lot of reading up, planning, drafting, and editing.

Remember, however, that applications for research associate/assistant positions are fairly different from those for industry jobs because you will be judged based primarily on your research record rather than on your more general skills. Your resume and cover letter will read quite differently from those of someone applying within industry.

> 💡 How I can help: I can help you customize your resume, cover letter, publication list, etc. based on the research role to which you are applying.
