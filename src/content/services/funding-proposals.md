While some institutions will compensate you for any work you do by default, others will require you to justify your expenses. Any time you apply for funding, ask yourself the following questions:

- Does the funding program in question cover my field and topic of research? Read up on the funder and what they stand for before you invest your time in applying. You probably don’t want to apply for a humanities funding program if you’re studying marine biology. Unless you are examining the musicality of dolphin whistles or something.  
- Does it come as a fixed amount or do I need to make specific requests? Most university grants and scholarships give you a lump sum of money to support your work, but there are a few that will ask you to explain how much you need for each stage of research.  
- How long will it take for me to put together my application and submit it? Look at the application form and find out which sections can be filled in immediately and which will need you to spend time thinking. Also, make a note of any sections that will require follow up from your end: for example, if you need references from employers, you want to give them a heads up as soon as possible.  
- Who can help me review my application before submission? This is a good question to ask yourself before any submission, really, but it’s especially important here because you stand to gain immediate financial benefits if your application is successful.

Obviously, it’s a good idea to make detailed plans and maintain strict records of any and all expenses incurred while working. Do not let guilt or self-doubt stop you from applying for funding! Let the funder worry about whether or not you are worth their financial support.
