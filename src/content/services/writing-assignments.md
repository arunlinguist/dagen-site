Most programs in the humanities and social sciences require you to submit written work in the form of essays. The problem is, not every institution teaches you how to write well.

There are three broad categories of essays you may come across:

- **Argumentative essays** — pieces of writing that make a case for something or the other, often bridging abstract ideas and the real world.  
- **Reflective essays** — these are expressions of the writer’s flow of thought: musings on all sorts of things, from life and the universe to what one should eat for breakfast.  
- **Descriptive essays** — these aim to capture a moment, event, or idea in as much detail as possible, with the purpose being to enthral the reader with a memorable mental image.

These categories are not always mutually exclusive, but on the whole, assignments will require you to produce one more than the others.
